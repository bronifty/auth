# Auth

- a manning 4 part liveproject beginning with [build an auth server](https://www.manning.com/liveproject/build-an-authorization-server)
- here is my current understanding of how oauth works
  ![JS Streams Observable](./media/oauth.png)

- building out the first part of the auth server with the following endpoints and reading about how it is based on events got me to thiking perhaps it would make sense to get deeper into this area with some more background before i proceed

  1. /.well-known/jwks.json
  2. .well-known/openid-configuration

## JS Node and Web Streams

- [erick wendell mastering node streams](https://hotmart.com/en/club/masteringnodejsstreams/products/2105756/content/2OM01a8x76)
- i jumped to this course and am bundling it with auth because i feel it may provide some good background material on events processing

---

```bash
node --inspect authorizationServer.js
chrome://inspect
```

## OAuth Flow State Management (code and token)

1. client /authorize

- redirect to server /authorize with query:{state, client_id, redirect_uri, response_type: "code"}

2. server /authorize

- filter for matching client_id, redirect_uri, scopes
- save query in requests[reqid]

```js
/*** current global state on auth server ***/
var clients = [
  {
    client_id: "oauth-client-1",
    client_secret: "oauth-client-secret-1",
    redirect_uris: ["http://localhost:9000/callback"],
    scope: "foo bar",
  },
];

// requests object
var requests = {
  nrOdghFy: {
    response_type: "code",
    client_id: "oauth-client-1",
    redirect_uri: "http://localhost:9000/callback",
    state: "gHddFXaImCl0ao6IGd1mktiDPTeY4hW4",
  },
};

var codes = {};

/*** end global state ***/
```

- render approve form with client, scope, and reqid
- user POSTS form to /approve endpoint with user, reqid, and scope

3. server POST /approve

- use reqid from POST request to pull that query object out from the previously saved requests object and in this implementation we are referring to it as query, which matches the original query parameters object from the client's /authorize request

```js
var query = {
    response_type: "code",
    client_id: "oauth-client-1",
    redirect_uri: "http://localhost:9000/callback",
    state: "gHddFXaImCl0ao6IGd1mktiDPTeY4hW4",
  },
```

- now we have retrieved the query from the client and passed it through a user (resource owner) authorization endpoint, so we can remove the original request object and upgrade it into a code object where it will be subsequently upgraded to a token
  - the flow is:
    1. query (from client /authorize)
    2. request (from server /authorize)
    3. code (from server /approve)
    4. token (from server /token)
